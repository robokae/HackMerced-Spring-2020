Habtivate was first conceived as a small project worked on by three undergraduate students at the University of California, Merced's fifth annual hack-a-thon. As a web application intended to promote the cultivation of good habits and friendly accountability, Habtivate's fundamental core values align with the hack-a-thon's themes: social good, sustainability, and health. The developers' strive to build habits within individuals which will inspire a community to reach their full potential.
